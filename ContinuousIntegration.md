# Definition of Continuous Integration and How It Can Improve Productivity and Competitiveness of a Company



Continuous integration (CI), is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. One of the benefits for companies that utilize the CI process is that the CI process reduces errors and manual tasks. Continuous integration requires teams to standardize practices, so that process can be easily repeated. With CI, since code is being regularly tested, this allows the developers to identify and resolve any issues early in the process. As it relates to the business itself, with the CI process, this helps ensure reliability, high-quality releases that have fewer errors and bugs that could reduce their effectiveness. With CI reducing manual tasks and errors, this also leads to a reduced cost from fewer outages. Lastly, the CI process ensures that software is delivered to the market faster. This allows the companies to use their enhanced functionality to improve products and services for customer and take a competitive edge in the market.
