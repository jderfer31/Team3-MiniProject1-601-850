## Benefits: ##
   The first advantage of using docker is return on investment.
   The more a solution can drive down costs while raising profits, the better a solution it is, especially for large, established companies, which need to generate steady revenue over the long term.
 Docker allows engineering teams to be smaller and more effective.

   Docker is fast, allowing you to quickly make replications and achieve redundancy. Also, launching Docker images is as fast as running a machine process.

   Docker enables you to build a container image and use that same image across every step of the deployment process. The length of time it takes from build to production can be sped up notably.

   Also, Docker is useful for many other reasons like rapid deployment, it's simplicity and faster configuration process, the multicloud platforms it provides, and in the security field too.
